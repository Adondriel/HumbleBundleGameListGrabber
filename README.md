# HumbleBundleGameListGrabber
This script will grab the names of all your available games in your humble bundle key library page, and print the list to the console.

Use this script while on this page: https://www.humblebundle.com/home/keys

This will automatically change the page and then append the next games, it is almost instant after running the script.

This script uses the page's ordering/sorting, so before running this script select the sort order you want, and whether or not to "hide redeemed keys"
Always start this script on the first page of keys.
